# TigerSwarm

## Presentation

[Here](https://youtu.be/Pp0payibvJI) you can find the presentation and demo of the project.

## Usage

You need a TigerBeetle instance running locally on port `3000` (or change the `addresses` variable
in `lib/tigerswarm/application.ex` to point to your instance).

You also need to have `elixir` [installed on your system](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html). If
you use [`asdf`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git)  with the
[`erlang`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang) and
[`elixir`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir) plugins you can just run `asdf install` in the
root of the project to install all the right versions of the tools.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
